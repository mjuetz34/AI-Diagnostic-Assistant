Okay, let's break down what's happening and what the doctors are thinking. You're experiencing some pain and discomfort around your anus, and the medical team is trying to figure out the exact cause. Here's a simplified explanation of the possible diagnoses and why they're considering them:

**The Main Problem: Pain and Discomfort Around the Anus**

The primary symptom is pain in the anal area, along with difficulty with bowel movements. This suggests something is physically wrong in that region.

**Possible Diagnoses (and Why They're Thinking of Them):**

1.  **Perianal Thrombosis with Secondary Inflammation/Infection (Most Likely):**

    *   **What it is:** A blood clot (thrombosis) has formed in the veins around your anus.
    *   **Why it fits:** The pain is a key symptom of this. The clot itself causes pain and swelling. Difficulty with bowel movements and a feeling of blockage are also common. The slightly elevated temperature (subfebrile) suggests your body is reacting to the clot, causing inflammation, and there's a chance of a secondary infection due to the clot's location.
2.  **Abscess with Perianal Thrombosis:**

    *   **What it is:** An abscess is a pocket of pus caused by an infection. It's located near the anus. The thrombosis could be a secondary finding or a contributing factor.
    *   **Why it fits:** The pain, difficulty with bowel movements, and potential for obstruction can all be caused by an abscess. The slightly elevated temperature strongly suggests an infection, which is a key feature of an abscess.
3.  **Hemorrhoids with Secondary Thrombosis and Inflammation/Infection:**

    *   **What it is:** Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum. They can become thrombosed (clotted), inflamed, and possibly infected.
    *   **Why it fits:** Hemorrhoids can cause pain, swelling, and difficulty with bowel movements. The slightly elevated temperature could be due to inflammation or infection of the hemorrhoid. This is less likely if the primary finding is clearly a perianal thrombosis, but it should be considered in the differential.

**In Simple Terms:**

The doctors are looking at a few possibilities: a blood clot, an abscess, or a problem with hemorrhoids. They're considering these based on your symptoms (pain, difficulty with bowel movements, and temperature) and what they might see upon examination. The elevated temperature is a clue that inflammation or infection might be involved. The diagnostic process will involve a physical exam and possibly other tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.
